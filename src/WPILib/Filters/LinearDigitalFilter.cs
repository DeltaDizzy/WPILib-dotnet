    /// <remarks>
    /// All types of FIR and IIR filters are supported.Static factory methods are provided to create commonly used types of filters.	
    ///	<para></para>
    /// Filters are of the form:	
    ///  y[n] = (b0*x[n] + b1*x[n-1] + ... + bP*x[n-P) - (a0*y[n-1] + a2*y[n-2] + ... + aQ*y[n-Q])
    /// <para></para>
    /// Where:	
    ///  y[n] is the output at time "n"	
    ///  x[n] is the input at time "n"	
    ///  y[n - 1] is the output from the LAST time step ("n-1")    
    /// x[n - 1] is the input from the LAST time step("n-1") 
    /// b0...bP are the "feedforward" (FIR) gains	
    /// a0...aQ are the "feedback" (IIR) gains	
    /// IMPORTANT! Note the "-" sign in front of the feedback term! This is a common 
    /// convention in signal processing.  
    ///	<para></para>
    /// What can linear filters do? Basically, they can filter, or diminish, the 
    /// effects of undesirable input frequencies.High frequencies, or rapid changes,    
    /// can be indicative of sensor noise or be otherwise undesirable. A "low pass"	
    /// filter smooths out the signal, reducing the impact of these high frequency   
    /// components.Likewise, a "high pass" filter gets rid of slow-moving signal	
    /// components, letting you detect large changes more easily.    
    ///	3<para></para>
    /// Example FRC applications of filters:	
    ///  - Getting rid of noise from an analog sensor input (note: the roboRIO's FPGA	
    ///    can do this faster in hardware)   
    ///  - Smoothing out joystick input to prevent the wheels from slipping or the   
    /// robot from tipping    
    ///  - Smoothing motor commands so that unnecessary strain isn't put on	
    /// electrical or mechanical components	
    ///  - If you use clever gains, you can make a PID controller out of this class!	
    ///	<para></para>

    /// Note 1: PIDGet() should be called by the user on a known, regular period.    
    /// You can set up a Notifier to do this (look at the WPILib PIDController   
    /// class), or do it "inline" with code in a periodic function.  
    ///	<para></para>
    /// Note 2: For ALL filters, gains are necessarily a function of frequency.If	
    /// you make a filter that works well for you at, say, 100Hz, you will most	
    /// definitely need to adjust the gains if you then want to run it at 200Hz!	
    /// Combining this with Note 1 - the impetus is on YOU as a developer to make	
    /// sure PIDGet() gets called at the desired, constant frequency!
